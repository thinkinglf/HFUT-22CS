大家好。今天我来给大家分享我最喜欢的电影之一：肖申克的救赎。
它有电影和小说两个版本。相比之下，我更喜欢电影。
故事的主人公安迪，被冤枉进了臭名昭著的肖申克监狱。
瑞德。他是故事的重要角色。
心中要有光。安迪每天都在计划这逃出去。
通过瑞德，安迪买了一把石锤。之后，他又买了一张丽塔海华丝的美人图挂在墙上。
阳光透过冰冷的栅栏照在他甜美的脸上，这令安迪心里有种说不出的滋味。
一天，典狱长诺顿来查房，在他面前背圣经：“我是世界的光，跟从我的就不必再黑暗里行走，必须得跟着着生命中的光。”
受到典狱长的启发安迪在圣经中挖了一大块，把石锤藏在里面。
由于帮助狱警们洗钱，安迪的日子慢慢好过了起来。
后来他被安排管理图书室。他不断争取图书和经费，改善狱友们的精神生活
安迪每晚都在挖一条通往外界的洞穴，坚持了18年。
在一个雷雨交加的夜晚，安迪逃离了肖申克，走向了自由。
他向报社曝光了典狱长和狱警们的罪证，最后他们也都受到了法律的惩罚。
最后瑞德和安迪两人重新相聚。
让我们感受这部影片的经典语句。
感谢大家的倾听。
Hello, everyone. Today, I'm going to share with you one of my favorite movies: The Shawshank Redemption.
It has two versions: film and novel.By contrast, I prefer movies.
Andy, the hero of the story, was wrongly imprisoned in the notorious Shawshank prison.
Reed.He is an important part of the story.
Have light in your heart. Andy plans to get out of here every day.
Through Reed, Andy bought a stone hammer.After that, he bought a beautiful picture of Rita Hayworth and hung it on the wall.
The sunshine shone on her sweet face through the cold fence, which made Andy feel unspeakable.
One day, Warden Norton came to make rounds and recited the Bible in front of him: "I am the light of the world. Those who follow me don't have to walk in the dark anymore, but have to follow the light of life."
Inspired by the warden, Andy dug a big piece in the Bible and hid the stone hammer in it.
Andy's life is slowly getting better because he helps prison guards launder money.
Later, he was assigned to manage the library.He constantly strives for books and funds to improve the spiritual life of his inmates.
Andy has been digging a cave to the outside world every night for 18 years.
On a thunderstorm night, Andy escaped from Shawshank and went to freedom.
He exposed the incriminating evidence of the warden and prison guards to the newspaper, and finally they were all punished by law.
Finally, Reed and Andy, two friends, reunited.
Then,let's feel the classic sentences of this film.
Thank you for listening.
